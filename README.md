Also I remember the time I deleted my ubuntu in my dual systems computer, which I chose the more compatibility in Windows for Oracle 11g.üò≠ Cause I forgot to backup my 2,000 tabs log and they've gone with my system. I really should leave some time for my stuff.

## Tech 

### Automatic

Maybe the whole what I touch and learn is `Python` & `Github`. The biggest feeling is automatuc task for format work, like how yihong0618 used in https://github.com/yihong0618/2021. And the routine in Android Phone like `bixby routines in oneui3.0+` & `iPhone Shortcuts/Workflow`. That's really awesome.

### the Second Brain

First Start I feel is `Notion Database`, I could search everything as long as I imported. What's more, the API of Notion is building now, the better futurn they ganna have. Buuut, I just wanna using `Logseq` & `Onedrive`, which give me a security and data-keeping.

And I would use more ways to import logseq, such as email, rss feeds, github issue and so on. That must be huge and effciency to me. 

The last feeling: Microsoft is nice, at least is Github. :-)

## Play & Consume & Others

The road I reading is tortuous with my change of environment. To begin with, I brought a 15.6 portable screen, yet been broken by SF-EMS when I sell it, cause I've bought a Samsung Pad, for easiler to take and reading documents. In few last days of 2021, I found a nice DELL screen in second-hand market(XianYu), I can't control myself, soonly I paid it, and take it in Dec 31^th^, 2021. It's really awesome.

## Final

So much feelings want to share, But the time is limited.  

In a short, I'll leave this for the next year. Read more, Listen more, and Create more. That's What I thought in 2022. Good Luck, Nice Guy. üåà
