Also I remember the time I deleted my ubuntu in my dual systems computer, which I chose the more compatibility in Windows for Oracle 11g.😭 Cause I forgot to backup my 2,000 tabs log and they've gone with my system. I really should leave some time for my stuff.

Maybe the whole what I touch and learn is `Python` & `Github`. The biggest feeling is automatuc task for format work, like how yihong0618 used in https://github.com/yihong0618/2021. And the routine in Android Phone like `bixby routines in oneui3.0+` & `iPhone Shortcuts/Workflow`. That's really awesome.
